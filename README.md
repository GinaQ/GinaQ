- 👋 Hi, I’m @GinaQ
- 👀 I’m interested in all software development... haven't found my niche yet. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, but have some experience in mobile apps, games, and older linux/bash scripting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any java project. I'm a pretty decent, albeit slow, bug hunter.
- 📫 How to reach me: admin@ginacodes.com
